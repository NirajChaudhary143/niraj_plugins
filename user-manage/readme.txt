User Manage plugin.

I have made registration form for the admin so that he/she can add employee details.
shortcode for the employee registration is 
----> [um_registration_employee] <----

Admin can view employee details.
shortcode for the employee details:
----> [um_employee_table] <-----

Admin can perform CRUD operation.
Form submission, Table Ordering and display data is done using jQuery AJAX.
